API: /v1/transaction/transfer

- This API facilitates the transfer of funds between two accounts. Below is a high-level breakdown of its core functionality:

- Transaction Execution: The TransactionService, AccountService, and relevant repositories are invoked to process the fund transfer.

- Audit and History: Transaction details are recorded in the TransactionHistory, which is essential for auditing purposes.

- Thread Safety: Critical sections of the code are synchronized to ensure thread safety.

- Error Handling: Proper HTTP error codes are returned when exceptions occur.


 
Tasks to Implement


- Authentication & Authorization: Ensure only authorized users can initiate fund transfers.

- Account Validation: Implement validation mechanisms to prevent BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) attacks.

- Logging: Add proper logging to ensure traceability and debugging capabilities.

- Database Transactions: Use JPA and transaction management to handle database operations consistently.

- Business-Specific Transaction History: Record transaction history separately based on specific business requirements.
